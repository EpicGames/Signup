# Epic Games

I’ve followed the instructions here (multiple times).
I first tried 2 months ago, and have since submitted a ticket without any response. I just again tried to reconnect and connect, with no luck.
I never get “an email inviting you to join the @EpicGames organization on GitHub.” When I try to view the codebase, I get a 404.

I do get an email from github informing me of the connection, and I can verify that I’ve successfully connected my account.

Just let a guy see the code.
