Unreal Engine is now [free](https://www.unrealengine.com/blog/ue4-is-free)!
but we hate Iranians also we dont want to show you our code although we are an open source project if you are an iranian.
so dont try to do anything like signing up.and see the code we will never accept and get you permissions to seeing code.
also we talking with other opensource projects like github and also all other free ones like google search to ban iranians prementelly from the world cuz of the name of random country them have been born.
